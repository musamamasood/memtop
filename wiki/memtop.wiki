#summary Displays memory consumption by processes in easy to read way.

= Introduction =

Python script for linux. Intended to help with diagnose and identification which processes uses most of RAM of PC.

Typical situation is when you need to reduce RAM usage of your box or you want to monitor your system for longer period of time to find out misbehaving applications. 

The script calculates amount of private/writeable for each process (using /proc/$PID/maps files) and prints biggest ones. It completely ignores private/non-writeable and shared memory. The reasons are:

  * shared memory is hard to interpret and at the end you still can not say 'how much memory is proces x taking'.
  * when tracking memory use of a process over time, private/writeable memory is most iteresting portion of process's memory use. Memtop will help you to find out how it changes over time. Also keep in mind that problems like memory leaks will be shown just in this number...
  * private/writeable memory is supposed to be an amount that will be freed in 'memory' (here the term includes both: RAM and swap) when process terminates
  * there are other tools to show this kind of info, so no need to include it also here


In addition to pure listing of processes and their memory use, it can track memory use in general way and help you identify periods when your system is short of RAM and how bad it is. For more info, scroll down to "Additional memory utilization info" section.

This example shows "graph" mode, and here the third column "previous" indicates change against previous iteration. It is just to visualise what program (its RAM occupation) is growing or shrinking.

<br>

== Use ==

No installation is needed, just run the script. Available parameters are

|| -p $integer   ||wait time between iterations (in minutes)||
||-s graph|numb||two alternatives how to present mainly data from former iteration||
|| -l $integer||number of lines - processes to show||
||-m ||more info about memory utilization (since 0.9.4)||
||-h||help||



Important note: The script should be *run as root* or you will not get data for processes running under other users.

== Additional memory utilization info, introduced from 0.9.4 ==

From this release you can use swith "-m" / "-more" to get two additional lines:

{{{

 11192 |  21.2 MB |    ++++  |tea                                                                               
    Writeable/RAM: =================================  76.7%
    RAM use without cached pages: 43.3% , SWAP use: 50.3%                            <-  here
    Swapping: 0/0, Paging: 0/4 (in/out / sec). Status in words: None or negligible.    <-  here
}}}

While "writeable" information can be used to track memory use of single processes, especially memory leaks and so, "RAM use without cached pages" gives single number of your physical RAM utilization. It based on /proc/meminfo and consideres three lines:

  * MemTotal - as size of your RAM
  * MemFree  - as free portion of RAM
  * Cached   - "...in-memory cache for files read from the disk..." - this portion of RAM is not reported as free (not included in MemFree) but due to the character of data, kernel can drop stored data immediately and use freed capacity as needed

For SWAP use it uses SwapTotal & SwapFree

Second new line and last one in the example is about swapping & paging. This information doesn't say "How full your RAM is" but monitors symptoms of RAM shortage. Here I also added "Text evaluation" of numbers for better. This test examines 5 seconds period but numbers are second averages.

The scale for text evaluation is below. The memtop sums all 4 numbers together and then based on result it prints:

  * sum < 20: None or negligible.
  * sum < 50: Increased, but still no problem.
  * sum < 150: Something is going on?
  * sum < 600: Swapping/paging intensively!
  * else: System went crazy!!!!

Feel free to suggest any changes to the scale, my experiences with paging are very limited...

== Changes after 0.9.0 ==

This is a new version after some 3 years, I "ported" it to python3 (still working with version 2.7 at least) and fixed problems when grepping its output. Sometimes it did not get through pipe at all (I dont understand why) but the main problem was that the grep command used to return error "Binary file matches". It showed that names of listed programs contained binary characters, not visible in console but still affecting grep.
